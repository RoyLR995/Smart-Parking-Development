# Smart-Parking-Development

Parking management influences drivers' search time and cost for parking spaces. It may also cause traffic congestion. Finding a parking space in most metropolitan areas, especially during rush hours, is difficult for drivers. The difficulty arises from not knowing where the available spaces may be at that time traffic congestion may occur.

1) This system can give the user information about parking spaces.

2) The main motivation of this project is to reduce the traffic that occurs in urban areas which is caused by vehicles searching for parking.
